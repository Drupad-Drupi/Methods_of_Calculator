# Nested If Simple Calculator

## Description
This is a simple calculator program written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations using a nested if-else structure. The program allows users to select an operation and input two numbers to compute the result. The calculator runs in a loop until the user decides to exit.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (Handles division by zero)
- Continuous execution until user chooses to exit
- Input validation for incorrect options

## Usage
1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose an operation by entering a number from the menu.
3. Enter two numbers as inputs.
4. View the result of the operation.
5. Choose whether to continue or exit the program.

## Menu Options
- `1` -> Addition
- `2` -> Subtraction
- `3` -> Multiplication
- `4` -> Division
- `5` -> Exit the program

## Example Execution
```
Enter the value for
 1-->Addition
 2-->Subtraction
 3-->Multiplication
 4-->Division
 5-->Exit
 Option: 1
Enter the first value: 10
Enter the second value: 5
Sum of 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
```

## Error Handling
- If the user inputs an invalid option, the program displays an error message.
- If the user attempts to divide by zero, a warning is shown to prevent a runtime error.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Save the script as `calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the command:
   ```
   python calculator.py
   ```
